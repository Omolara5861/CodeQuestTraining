    <h2>I ðŸ’– you Mom</h2>
    <p>
        I know it's not mother's day yet, but mother's day shouldn't be the only day I tell you how amazing you are and grateful I am. So below are few of my heartfelt messages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Today, I want to let you know that your dedication to me does not go unnoticed. Thank you for encouraging me to be the most perfect woman I could possibly be.</li>
        <li>Thank you for all the sacrifices you have made for me and doing everything possible to help me grow and excel in life. I will forever be grateful for everything, Mom.
        </li>
        <li>I know very well that you have never lived a life of your own beyond raising me. Most of your time could have been spent concentrating on your career, but instead, you focused your efforts on caring for me. Thank you for being a great mom and for always making me your priority.</li>
        <li>Because of you, I have the vision to reach for my dreams, and the grit to push through the challenges that are in my way. Thank you for making me strong. You are the best mom a guy/girl could ever have!
        </li>
        <li>I know we argue, but please know that you are the most essential, the most critical, and the most important person in my life. I couldnâ€™t be who I am without your support and devotion. Thank you for forgiving me when I mess up, and loving me as if nothing had ever happened. You are amazing.
        </li>
        <li>Some moms deserve to be celebrated. You deserve an entire parade! Mom, I could never even hope to express just how much appreciation I hold in my heart for you, my loving mom. You have helped me in the toughest of times and you have celebrated by my side in the best of times. I am forever thankful for and to you. I love you with everything I have, and more. Thank you for being my mom.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>My greatest wish and dream in life is to take a very good care of you and give you that type of life you so much desire. But I wish to do the following before the end of this year:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take you shopping on your birthday</li>
        <li>Clear all your debt</li>
        <li>Grant 3 of your wishes</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
